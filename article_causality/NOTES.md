### Network service operations [source](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gr/NFV-REL/001_099/010/03.01.01_60/gr_NFV-REL010v030101p.pdf) ###

- Resilency Operations:
	- **Scaling**, i.e. the dynamic provisioning or deprovisioning of resources granted to VNFs;
		- violation of the forwarding graph dependencies in one (or several) VNF(s) of the network service;
		- violation of the dependencies in a nested network service (e.g. how two nested NSs are linked to each other);
		- unprotected new network service instance (e.g. failure to scale out a new pair of VNFs);
		- malfunction of old/new network service instance; etc.
		- In case the composite network service NS2 shown in Figure 6.1 has to be scaled out, if the two composite network services NS1 and NS2 do not have the same priority (e.g. one of them is more critical than the other), the higher priority composite network service needs to be served first, i.e. the scaling out process will start with its VNFs.
 	- **Migration**, i.e. the move of virtualised resources from one set of physical resources to another;
 		- maintenance purposes, e.g. NFVI software/hardware modification, servers addition/removal;
 		- service restoration following failures;
 		-  failure prevention through a deep analysis of appropriate KPIs.
 		- As a result of such a process "live migration" still may cause a detectable interruption of the VM which could
create inconsistency in the VNF if not considered and handled properly.
	 - **Restoration** following failures if resources are available;
	 	- hardware/software failures among the compute/storage resources;
	 	- loss of connectivity both locally or in a wide-area perimeter;
	 	- overload due to unusual high traffic demand (caused by a legitimate event or attacks);
	 	- failure of scaling or migration processes;
	 	- system misconfiguration;
	 	-  if several network service instances chained together are impacted by the failure, some particular instances may need to be restored before others if sequential constraints are present;
	 	- if both shared network service(s) and dedicated network service(s) are impacted by the failure, VNFs composing the shared network service(s) have to be restored first to minimize the global service unavailability;
		- if both shared network service(s) and dedicated network service(s) are impacted by the failure, VNFs composing the shared network service(s) have to be restored first to minimize the global service unavailability;
		- Handling of the restoration procedures has to take into consideration the NS instance priority attribute, therefore NFVO would prioritize accordingly the restoration of NS instances that have different levels of priority.
	 - **Resource reallocation**, i.e. restoration if the desired resources are insufficient.

### Definitions
**Administrative domain**: collection of systems and networks operated by a single organization or administrative authority [source](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-IFA/001_099/010/02.01.01_60/gs_nfv-ifa010v020101p.pdf)

**VNF Lifecycle Operation Granting:** permission to perform a VNF lifecycle management operation and the resource management operations necessary to complete it, if any apply. [source](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-IFA/001_099/010/02.01.01_60/gs_nfv-ifa010v020101p.pdf)

### Use case:  Network Services provided using multiple administrative domains [source](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gr/NFV-IFA/001_099/028/03.01.01_60/gr_NFV-IFA028v030101p.pdf)

**Definition:** This use case describes a network operator offering Network Services (NS) to different departments within the same operator, as well as facilitating the offering of these NSs to another network operator. The use case considers a single NFVO per administrative domain.

Figure 1. Composite NS and nested NSs example. In this example, the two constituent nested NSs which build up the composite NS are offered by administrative domains different than the one offering the composite NS itself.

####NFVO-Roles

A single NFVO can play both provider consumer role. The VNFMs in each administrative domain interact with the NFVO (either NFVO-1 or NFVO-2) of the same administrative domain. NFVO-1 is not aware of the constituent VNF instances of the nested NS instance, and hence NFVO-1 does not interact with the VNFMs in the administrative domain of NFVO-2.

#### Composite NS scaling in sharing scenario

 On-boarding flows are asynchronous: i.e. no timing constraints exist between two consecutive on-boarding calls. The operational flow in this clause provides a variant scenario of composite NS scaling in which the
nested NS instance composing the composite NS instance is shared by other composite NS instances. In this scenario, when NFVO-2 receives the Scale NS request from NFVO-1, NFVO-2 further initiates corresponding granting procedure to the NFVO who manages the composite NS instance using the shared nested NS instance.

Fig 3. Composite NS scaling in sharing scenario.  It is possible that scaling on multiple layers of nested NSs can propagate across multiple administrative domains. For simplicity purpose, it is assumed that only one layer of nested NS is applied in this use case

When the NFVO-* checks the NS consistency  (e.g. dependency between the nested NS instance and other constituent of the composite NS instance it manages) which might be impacted by the nested NS scaling operation. If the composite NS consistency is guaranteed by this scaling operation, then NFVO-i approves the grant request. Otherwise, NFVO-i rejects the grant request.
