## Writing tips [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM)

1. Readers read things that are valuable to them.
2. Writing has to be clear, organized, persuasive but most important VALUABLE.
3. Writing is not about communicating your ideas, but changing reader's ideas.
4.  A piece of writing is important is not because it is new and original, it is because it has value to some readers,
5.  Every research communities have their own code to communicate VALUE. Learn their words.
6. The function of a piece of writing is to move a research area forward, not to be preserved for 500 years.
7. Bad writing style: backgroud+thesis; much better to use problem+solution. The "Martini shaped" model is good to help us in our work, but no tension and therefore value for readers.
8. Literature review is used to enrich the problem. Instead of bulding a background and saying, X did this, Y did this, Z did this is much better to use: When X did this there were, but then Y in showed that, however Z did this which gives a point to Y but its does not negate X. This way you build the problem. A story is developed where you fit.
9. Gap in knowledge is dangerous since assumes a finite model of knowledge. In other words, is to say hey you have studided this phenomenon but you have not think of this.
10. Command small stress in the sentence. Instead of writing all small sentences.
11. This "tell/describe us what the paper is about X". I cannot establish value using this model. 
	- Another "What the paper will argue". My paper will argue cultural constructions dynamic instead of "My paper is about cultural constructions". 
	- How about "tell you what question the paper will answer". This makes for the reader, "tells you what question you have".
12. Tools vs Idea. Tools involve use
13. Identify the people who assume something that is wrong. This creates value.
14. Language is social, is a relationship between other people not just me. Traditionally, you demostrate and you show. 
15. From the first sentence, show what the reader should be reading

## Paragraphs [source](https://www.amazon.com/Scientists-Guide-Writing-Effectively-throughout-ebook/dp/B01C4V8RFW)

A paragraph is a unit of logical organization best thought of as introducing and treating a single idea.  They have three important properties : they are unified, coheren and distinct. 

### Unification.
If your paragraph is to be unified around a single idea, you need to know, and tell your reader, what that idea is. Clearly declaring the paragraph’s central idea is the job of its topic sentence. The power sentences are the beginning and the other is its last sentence, a good place for a succinct statement of the paragraph’s takehome message. A topic sentence declares the paragraph’s central idea, but does not have to fully explain it.  Every sentence in your paragraph should contribute to developing the idea announced by the topic sentence. Remember:  each sentence relates clearly to the idea declared in the topic sentence.

### Coherence

If the sentences that make up a unified paragraph are to work together to develop its idea, they need to present material in a logical order, and to relate each step of idea development to the next. Signalling by the topic sentence can alert your reader of organization of material to come. In pursuit of coherence, good organization is complemented by “relational devices”: words or structures that indicate relationships between sentences. These include:

Parallel construction and word choice
Repetition
Transitional expressions: also, because, hence, then.

### Distinction

Paragraphs should be logically distinct: each with its own topic, and each providing a complete and selfcontained treatment of that topic. The meaning of “complete and selfcontained” is a bit subtle, though.

### Writing tips 
* Place a comma before (*and, but, or, for, as, while*) introducing an independent clause. (e.g. This night has been a complete disaster, but a soda would probably salvage things).
* Join independent clauses with semicolon (e.g. It's nearly midnight already; there's no way we're getting home before curfew). Also when the second clause is preceded by an adverb (e.g. I'd never been inside her bedroom before that night; besides, I was drunk as a skunk. 
* Participal phrases that are preceded by a conjunction or a preposition, adjectives and adjectives phradrd all come under the same rule if they begin a sentence). 
	*  Drunk and horny, the man seemed attractive to me. (WRONG)
	*  Drunk and horny, I thought the man attractive (RIGHT)
* Use Active voice.
* Choose positive over negative. Also, restraint from using conditional clauses like (*would, can, may*)
	* He was not very sober.
	* **He was usually drunk. RIGHT**
	* Singh may be thought of as a drunkard and a liar. WRONG
	* **Singh is thought of as a drunkard and a liar. RIGHT**
* Simmetry should be used. 
	* I'll take the blond, the brunette, redhead, and Hispanic chick (Wrong)
	*  **I'll take the blond, the brunette, the redhead, an the Hispanic chick (RIGHT)**
	* Either you should meet the terrorist's demands or say good-bye to your daughter. (WRONG)
	* **You should either meet the terrorist's demands or say good-bye to your daughte. (RIGHT)**
* Hyphen! When you're putting together two separate words to form a complex adjective, a hyphen is required (e.g. He indulged in round-the-clock, pot smoking). However, there are certain words that through repetition have ceased to require hypens (e.g. goddamn)

### Structuring a Sentence: Word Order

#### Place the various elements in your sentence in the most logical order possible: don't force the reader to have to change their perspective.
Readers expect words/phrases that are closely related to each other, to appear next to each other withing the sentence.  

| Incorrect      | Correct |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|It is important to remark that our components are of a traditional design. *However*, we want to stress that the way the components are assembled is very innovative.      | Although our components are of a traditional design, the way they are assembled is very innovative.       |

#### Don't delay the subject.

Think what to place at the beginning of the first sentence since search engines and humans tend to place more attention in that location. 

* Incorrect sentence: *As a consequence of the preceding observations*, x is equal to y
* **Correct:** X is equal to y as a consequene of the preceding observations.

Putting *it* in the first position often delays the real subject. Instead, use modal verbs (*might, need, should* etc.) where possible:
* Incorrect: It is mandatory to use the new version.
* **Correct:** The new version must be used 

#### Locate negations near the beginning of the sentence

The order you put the words in your sentence should be designed to take your reader through a logical progression of thoughts. These thoughts should move forward, never backtracking, never forcing the reader to reconsider or reinterpret what they have just read in the light of what they are reading now. 

In S1 and S2 readers cannot predict how the sentence might progress. They are forced to wait to the end before being able to understand what they have just read.

* S1. Data regarding the thyroid function and the thyroid antibodies before the beginning of the therapy *were not available.*
* S2. *All* of the spectra of volatiles *did not* show absorptions in the range ...
	
Instead S3 and S4 help the reader to immediately understand the central purposeand driving force of the sentence (also known as the 'thrust of a sentence').

* S3. *No data were available* regarding thyroid function and thyroid antibodies before the beginning of the therapy.
* S4. *None* of the spectra of the volatiles showed absorptions in the range ... 
	
#### State your aim before giving the reasons for it

When you explain a new game to someone, do you tell them the rules/strategies and then the objective or vice/versa?

### Structuring Paragraphs

#### First paragraph of a new section - begin with a mini summary plus an indication of the structure

Readers do not necessarily read the paper from beginning to end. They may begin with any section in the paper. This means you could consider starting some sections (e.g Introduction, Discussion, Conclusions) with a one or two-sentence summary of the main aims and/or findings of the paper.

* As mentioned in the Introduction, a principal concern in the field of X is to understand why... This section attempts to answer the question...
* Our aim is to provide a simple alternative to the complex theoretical models that attempt to explain... In this section we present a simplified model, which we believe is...

In addition to this mini summary, some authors also briefly outline what will be contained in the rest of the section:

* In this section, the numerous advances in cosmology are described, with emphasis on the vast new area of ...

#### First paragraph of a new section - go directly to the point

Examples: S1 and S2

* S1. An analysis of the number of words used in English with respect to Italian, showed that the average sentence in English was 25 words long, whereas in Italian it was 32 words long (see Table 1). This indicates that when an Italian documents is translated into English, there is...
* S2.  Italian tends to use more words per sentence than English, so when an Italian document is translated into English, there is...

#### Begin a new paragraph when you begin to talk about your study and your key findings.

### Breaking up long sentences

The upper limit for a sentence is about 25 words. 

#### Avoid *which* and relative clauses when these create long sentences

| Incorrect      | Correct |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| English, *which* has now become the world's international language and is studied by more than a billion people in various parts of the world thus giving rise to an industry of English language textbooks and teachers, is generally used in scientific papers. | English is generally used in scientific papers. In fact, Englis has now become the world's international language and is studied by more than a billion people in various parts of the world. This has given rise to an industry of English language textbooks and teachers. |

#### Avoid the -*ing* form to link phrases together

One way writers typically link phrases toghether is to used the -*ing* form of a verb.

| Incorrect      | Correct |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Using automatic translation software (e.g. Google Translate, Babelfish, and Systran) can considerably ease the work of researchers when they need to translate docments *thus saving* them money (for example the fee they might have otherwise had to pay to a professional translator) and *increasing* the amount of time they have to spend in the laboratory rather than at the PC. | Using automatic translation software (e.g. Google Translate, Babelfish, and Systran) can considerably ease the work of researchers when they need to translate documents. *Such software saves* them money, for example the fee they might have otherwise had to pay to a professional translator.

### Mathematics and computer science citations [source pag. 139](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H9HF96S)

Papers in mathematics and computer science use one of two citation styles. The first places an alphabetical reference list at the end of the paper. References in the text are given by bracketed numbers. The first reference might be [23], referring to the twenty-third item in the alphabetical list. The last reference in the article might be [2]. Specific pages are rarely mentioned, but if you to need, use this form: [23, p. 14]. Please use the set of positive integers.

A second system, based on the Bulletin of the American Mathematical
Society, is often used by advanced mathematicians for publishable research. It, too, has an alphabetical reference list (aslightly different one), but what’s unusual arethetext references.Instead of bracketednumbers,thisstyleuses abbreviations, based on the author’s last name and date of publication. So an article by Hofbauer and Sandholm, published in Econometrica, volume 70 (2002), would be cited in the text assomething like [HoSa02] or perhaps [HS02] or maybe just [HS]. 

Article titles and book chapters are italicized. Capitalize only the first
word, the first word after a colon, and all proper nouns: A. R. Conn and P. L. Toint, An algorithm using quadratic interpolation for unconstrained derivative free optimization.

Book titles are capitalized normally and italicized: Nonlinear Optimization and Applications.

Journal titles are abbreviated but not italicized:
1. Ann. of Math.
2. Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.

Publications by the same author are listed in the order of publication,
beginning with the earliest. Use three em dashes to repeat an author’s
name, but do so only if all the authors are the same. For example:

1. [32] S. Kihara, On an elliptic curve over Q(t) of rank ≥ 14, Proc. Japan
Acad. Ser. A Math. Science. 77 (2001), pp. 50–51 MR
2002a:11057.
2. [33] ———, On an infinite family of elliptic curves with rank ≥ 14
over Q, Proc. Japan Acad. Ser. A Math. Science. 73 (1997), p. 32
MR 98d:11059.
